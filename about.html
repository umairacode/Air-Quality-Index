                The aim of the Malaysia Air Quality Index (MAQI) application is to create an informative application with seamless user interface to provide user with quality experience. 
                It also aims to provide users with real-time and reliable data on air quality, including pollutant concentrations, index ratings, and associated health risks. 
                By presenting this information in a clear and user-friendly manner, the application empowers individuals to assess the air quality in their immediate surroundings, 
                enabling them to take proactive measures to protect themselves and their loved ones from the adverse effects of pollution.

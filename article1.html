            Air pollution in Kuala Lumpur is something that has been of significant concern for its citizens for many years now, with huge amounts of smoke and haze afflicting the capital every year. 
            Kuala Lumpur has a very tropical climate, with high levels of humidity and rainfall occurring during most of the year. Despite the large amount of rain, which has a very cleansing effect on the atmosphere, Kuala Lumpur still suffers from its infamous smog that usually occurs during the latter part of the year.
            To observe the numbers from 2019â€™s recordings, Kuala Lumpur came in at second place out of the most polluted cities in Malaysia, with Putrajaya taking the first position, although it can be seen that there is data missing from the earlier part of the year for Putrajaya, skewing the results somewhat. 
            The readings of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 in the air that gave it this ranking came in at 21.5Âµg/mÂ³, putting it into the â€˜moderateâ€™ rating bracket, which requires a PM2.5 rating of between 12.1 to 35.4 Âµg/mÂ³ to be classed as moderate. 
            PM2.5 or fine particulate matter refers to particles that are 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter, making them approximately 100 times smaller than a human hair, and as such they are a great danger to human health due to their extremely small size and ability to penetrate deep into the lung tissue and enter the bloodstream.
            To follow, the pollution and smoke levels cause problems for the citizens of Kuala Lumpur by jumping up to significant figures at certain points in the year, and whilst the city comes in with a fairly low average when the numbers are taken as a sum total at the end of the year, during its worst month of September, the pollution levels reach numbers that rival some of the most polluted countries and cities in the world with ease. 
            A simple search on air pollution in Kuala Lumpur will reveal that a majority if not all of the most condemning articles and blogs are written in the month of September, and for good reason, one which will be discussed in further detail. 
            So, to summarize, for a big metropolitan city the average pollution levels are not particularly disastrous, but when they get bad, which they inevitably do, it is something that is unavoidable and can tarnish the whole year, with highly detrimental effects for anyone caught in the clouds of smoke and haze, particularly sensitive demographics such as children, the elderly and people with preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular conditions or compromised immune systems.

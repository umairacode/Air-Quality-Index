        <p class="paragraph">
            Besides the usual causes of pollution in all major cities across the world such as vehicular emissions, smoke and fumes from factories and other industrial sectors, the air pollution index (API) is sent skyrocketing during 
            certain months of the year by a singular and very well known cause, the slash and burn farming practices taking place in Indonesia, in particular Sumatra contributing the most to this problem. 
            Whilst the whole of south east Asia is affected by this problem in one form or another (whether it be locally made fires or winds blowing smoke and haze from the Indonesian fires over to other neighboring south east Asian countries such as Thailand), 
            it seems to be peninsular Malaysia that suffers the most from this, with state of emergencyâ€™s having to be declared, bringing many non-essential services to be closed, as well as other major inconveniences such as the shutting of schools and disrupted air travel.
            There have been numerous years that are marked down in history as having been extremely bad with their AQI ratings and levels of PM2.5 in the air, the most noteworthy years being the famous 1997 Southeast Asian haze, 
            as well as the years of 2005, 2006 and 2015 being recorded as having disastrous amounts of pollution lingering in the atmosphere, sometimes taking weeks to disperse and causing a huge amount of health issues and premature deaths amongst the citizens of Malaysia and neighboring Singapore. 
            To summarize, the number one cause in regards to the most dangerous months is the smoke caused by slash and burn farming from Indonesia, whilst the ambient levels of pollution are caused by emissions from the huge number of cars and trucks on the road, as well as factories, giving Kuala Lumpur its year-round â€˜moderateâ€™ PM2.5 rating and worsened levels of air quality.

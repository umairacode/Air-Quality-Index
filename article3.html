        <p class="paragraph">
            So far, there has been little respite or actual substantial ways of stopping the haze from occurring. There are government initiatives such as rain seeding, whereby artificial clouds are created that create an eventual downpour, 
            but these are transient in nature and once the rain is over the air can quickly return to its original highly polluted states, so essentially practices like rain seeding are putting a band aid over a more serious environmental wound that needs a more hands on approach.
            Larger and more powerful initiatives such as the creation of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution have been put into play, which is a legally recognized agreement whose sole purpose is to reduce the smog and haze that afflicts the whole region, and for the citizens of Kuala Lumpur this is of great importance. 
            The repeated incidences over 2005 and 2006 forced Malaysia and Singapore to put more pressure on Indonesia. All ten countries in ASEAN have signed and ratified the agreement as of September 2014. Despite this the haze continues to plague Kuala Lumpur each year, 
            with the following year of 2015 being another year that was put into the record books for its disastrous levels of haze and smoke permeating the cities air. Whilst the slash and burn farming practice has been made highly illegal and under intense international pressure to be put to a permanent stop, 
            it does not seem to have an end in sight as of yet, with farmers in Indonesia continuing to set fire to their crops, forest land as well as areas of peat soil, which release a plethora of highly toxic chemicals and compounds into the air such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), as well as black carbon (BC), 
            the primary component of soot and a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of organic materials and fossil fuels, having disastrous effects on both human health and the environment, being a contributor to global warming.
            So whilst there are initiatives being taken to reduce this practice, as well as the introduction of newer, cleaner and more efficient public transport lines in Kuala Lumpur such as their MRT lines and incentives to get the general 
            public to rely less on personal vehicles and thus reduce the ambient pollution levels, it seems to stand that the yearly spike of air pollution from burnt organic material may not be coming to an end in the immediate future, until enough international as well as local pressure takes place to fully put an end to the slash and burn farming practices once and for all.

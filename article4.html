        <p class="paragraph">
            Going off of the available data as taken from the PM2.5 readings over 2019, the highest level of pollution was recorded during the month of September, with a reading of 59.3 Âµg/mÂ³, putting this month into the â€˜unhealthyâ€™ bracket range. 
            In order to be classed as unhealthy, the reading needs to be anywhere between 55.5 to 150.4 Âµg/mÂ³. This represents a significant jump from the month prior to it, which came it at 25.5 Âµg/mÂ³, which shows that the level of PM2.5 doubled within the space of a month. 
            This reads true for many other cities in Malaysia, a large majority of them showing moderate ratings in August before rapidly jumping up to higher numbers in the following month, and then subsequently dropping back down to their previous ambient levels. 
            Although there is a lack of PM2.5 related data to go by in years prior for Malaysia, as mentioned before there are countless blogs and articles online detailing the severity of the haze during the month of September, as well as numerous archived stories recalling the catastrophic pollution levels appearing between August and October. 
            As such it is apparent that September is when the air quality is going to be at its worst in Kuala Lumpur.

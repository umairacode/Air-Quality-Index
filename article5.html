                <h6>AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS FOR KUALA LUMPUR</h6>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Now that it has been firmly established that the main offender for poor air quality in Kuala Lumpur is the fires being started in Indonesia, 
            there are some honorable mentions that have pertinent value to bring up. Although it was briefly touched upon earlier, car pollution is a topic that also needs addressing, 
            as there are numerous records in years past of pollution levels rising to dangerous levels despite there being no fires or drifting clouds of foreign smoke to pin the blame on. 
            There have been comparisons made that the air in Kuala Lumpur is similar to that of Beijingâ€™s, despite being a fraction of the size in terms of population and the number of industrial areas surrounding the city, 
            instead being surrounded with thick forests and jungle that help massively in reducing pollution levels. Citizens of Kuala Lumpur and indeed the whole country have a major dependency on cars. 
            Fuel prices are exceptionally low, as well as the price of car ownership, set to fall even lower due to the removal of certain taxes regarding the automobile industry (namely the GST tax). 
            Kuala Lumpur also has a long history of large fuel subsidies and large investment into road infrastructure, whilst leaving the public transport industry in the dust behind it. 
            The fallout from this is a huge reliance and overuse of personal cars, contributing heavily to the smoke and haze in the city. A reduction in this and further initiatives to reduce the number of cars on the road (such as car ownership limits, 
            with countries like Singapore placing a cap on the number of vehicles that are allowed in the city) would go a long way to reducing the pollution levels and assist in improving the air quality.

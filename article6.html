            Health issues and the risks associated with higher levels of PM2.5 and PM10 in the air are numerous, 
            including a myriad of problems, often primarily affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. 
            When the pollution reaches its highest levels in the air, a number of short-term problems can present themselves. 
            These include symptoms such as increased chance of lung and throat infections, as well as irritation to the skin, eyes and nasal passages. 
            PM10 can cause asthma sufferers to have higher numbers of acute attacks, as well as causing it to develop in individuals who may not have suffered from it before.
            Vulnerable sections of the population including young children who grow up exposed to these pollutants and thus breathe them in over prolonged periods of time, 
            can develop a decrease in their overall lung capacity, which can in turn stunt growth and cause developmental issues. 
            Pregnant mothers can also experience birth defects in their children if overexposed, due to the ability of the smaller sized PM2.5 to enter the bloodstream via the lungs and circulate to the rest of the body. 
            Once it has entered the bloodstream, instances of cancer can increase, due to the fine particulate matters ability to permeate deep into the lung tissue and stay there. 
            Along with the increased risk of cancer there is also chances for individuals to develop heart diseases and arrythmias, along with a heightened risk of heart attacks, particularly amongst the elderly or those with preexisting cardiac conditions. 
            Due to the large amount of health problems associated with breathing in elevated levels of pollution, it would be of interest to many people living in Malaysia to take preventative measures in regards to reducing their exposure to the smoke and haze that can fill the skies. 
            These measures may include the wearing of particle filtering masks during particularly bad spells, as well as referring to air quality maps that show daily and hourly updates of the air quality index (AQI), or air pollution index (API) as it is known locally in Malaysia. 
            Such maps are available to view on the IQAir website, as well as on the AirVisual app that delivers up to date reports on pollution levels direct to peopleâ€™s phones.
